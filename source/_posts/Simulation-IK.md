This is an OpenGL Simulation Application, which written by c++.

They are assignments 2 from course Animation Simulation University of Leeds


## Repo is [here](https://github.com/flwmxd/Simulations)


## Simulation 2 is Inverse Kinematics 

In computer animation and robotics, inverse kinematics is the mathematical process of calculating the variable joint parameters needed to place the end of a kinematic chain, such as a robot manipulator or animation character's skeleton, in a given position and orientation relative to the start of the chain.

### Numerical solutions to IK problems


#### The Jacobian inverse technique

### Skeleton Animation

Skeletal animation or rigging is a technique in computer animation in which a character (or other articulated object) is represented in two parts: a surface representation used to draw the character (called the mesh or skin) and a hierarchical set of interconnected parts (called bones, and collectively forming the skeleton or rig), a virtual armature used to animate (pose and keyframe) the mesh. 

In this project, the method is implementing the BVH files animation.
