# Introduction

Implement Nanite in my personal Game Engine( it is an experimental function now).  
the goal is to learn Nanite system. in my implementation, I implemented the virtual geometry generator, GPU-Driven Culling system, and VisibilityRendering. although it is not fully implementation, I still learnt lots of knowledge from it.

**Because Epic explained Nanite very well in [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eviSykqSUUw) and [paper](https://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2021/Karis_Nanite_SIGGRAPH_Advances_2021_final.pdf), I would not explain more tech details in my article.**
